## Pantry App

This is a simple inventory app designed for you to keep track of items in your pantry, fridge, and freezer. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) project connected to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/).

### Getting Started

Head over to the web app hosted on [Vercel](https://pantry-app-ten.vercel.app/)!

Note for security and budgetary reasons I have restricted write access to the Firestore database. 
You can reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshiroma/) to request access to the write permission. I will then open the app for an hour for you to experiment.
